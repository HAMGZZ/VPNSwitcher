# VPNSwitcher
VPNSwitcher was made to enable automatic switching between VPN endpoints to find the fastest server if the latency rises above a certain threshold. This is using the NORD VPN api - This code can be used as a shell for other commercial VPN services. This should be a drop in for anyone with NORD VPN and openwrt.
